# webpack-ts-online-template

A simple Node project "template"  that uses:

* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) - because it's awesome
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) - to bundle all of our Javascript together
* [Phaser](https://phaser.io) - the awesome game engine.

Clone it with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Robert923/webpack-ts-online-template.git

npm install
```

and then away you go!  :-)

To build it use:

```bash
npx webpack
```

And once it's built, you can use `live-server` if you have it installed with just:

```bash
live-server
```
